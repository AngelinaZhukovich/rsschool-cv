## Briefly About Myself:

*I am 27 years old and I am a beginner frontend developer. In October 2020, I went to the IT-Step Academy for career guidance courses and chose the frontend development since this profession is the closest to my personality. Front-end development is not just writing code, but embodying the design of a site or application in a code form, which requires special skills and abilities from a programmer.*


*For a year I have been immersing myself in the profession, going through online intensives and now I am studying at RS School. My professional principle is – do not stop, develop yourself and learn new things every day! The current place of employment relates to the government service and has nothing in common with the IT industry. In my opinion, the frontend development will help me realize myself professionally.*

## My skills:

+ HTML5, PUG (Basic),
+ CSS, SCSS (Basic)/ SASS(Basic),
+ JavaScript (Basic),
+ GitHub,
+ Avocode,
+ VS Code.

## Code example:

    function paperwork(n, m) {
      if (n>0 && m>0){
        return n*m
      } else {
        return 0
      }
    }

## English

*A2 (To improve my English skills I attend a course organized by the Minsk linguistic university).*
