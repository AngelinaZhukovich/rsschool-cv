        ## Briefly About Myself:

        *I am 27 years old and I am a beginner frontend developer. In October 2020, I went to the IT-Step Academy for
        career
        guidance courses and chose the frontend development since this profession is the closest to my personality.
        Front-end
        development is not just writing code, but embodying the design of a site or application in a code form, which
        requires
        special skills and abilities from a programmer.*


        *For a year I have been immersing myself in the profession, going through online intensives and now I am
        studying
        at RS
        School. My professional principle is – do not stop, develop yourself and learn new things every day! The current
        place
        of employment relates to the government service and has nothing in common with the IT industry. In my opinion,
        the
        frontend development will help me realize myself professionally.*
